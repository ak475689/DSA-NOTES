 an array arr[] of N elements containing first N positive integers. You have to sort the integers in ascending order by the following operation. Operation is to pick an integer and place it at end or at start. Every such operation increases cost by one. The task is to sort the array in the minimum cost


     int sortingCost(int N, int arr[]){
          map<int,int> mp;
        int mx =0;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
        {
           if(mp.find(arr[i]-1)!=mp.end())
           mp[arr[i]] = mp[arr[i]-1];
          
           mp[arr[i]]++;
           mx = max(mx ,mp[arr[i]]);
        }
        
        return N-mx;
        }
