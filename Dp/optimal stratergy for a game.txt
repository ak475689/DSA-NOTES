You are given an array A of size N. The array contains integers and is of even length. The elements of the array represent N coin of values V1, V2, ....Vn. You play against an opponent in an alternating way.

In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin.

You need to determine the maximum possible amount of money you can win if you go first.
Note: Both the players are playing optimally.

  //dp explanation:

  currently i will choose either a[i] or a[j] as my ans and move on. the opponent plays the move now and is determined to lower our score so now we have min 
  1)of (i+1,j-1) and (i+2,j)  // if we take a[i] as our ans he picks a[i] or a[j] accordingly and returns us the subsequent recursive functions
  2) of (i+1,j-1) and (i,j-2) // if we take a[j] as our ans he picks a[i] or a[j] accordingly and returns us the subsequent recursive functions
